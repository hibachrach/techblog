<h3 id="make-your-tools-as-ergonomic-as-possible">Make your tools as ergonomic as possible</h3>

<p>Ergonomics often comes up when talking with HR during onboarding: it’s the
reason why you should use comfortable, supportive chairs, keyboards, mice, and
such. “Battle scars” from work shouldn’t be encouraged. If your eyes, wrists, or
butt cheeks are hurting, try to address that problem. You’re doing labor. Labor
that most likely isn’t as tolling, as say, construction, but labor nonetheless.
Take care of your body. If you try to fight it, it’s likely to win. Even if
you’re not feeling active pain now, you might start experiencing symptoms after
years of damage. “It works for me” shouldn’t be the end of it. Get an ergonomic
chair, keyboard, and mouse to reduce strain. Here<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> are some good
guidelines on reducing eyestrain (I can personally vouch for tools like
<a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a>!).</p>

<p>What does this mean for software? If you don’t like the way you’re interacting
with your tools (physical <em>or</em> virtual), you’re not going to have as much fun
using them.</p>

<p>Sometimes that can be a <em>good</em> thing: if a tool
<em>shouldn’t</em> be used, then you can design your system with that idea in mind. As
we are all designers in some way, this should be a familiar idea—e.g. if you
add a feature that forces a user to do 10 clicks instead of one, they’re less
likely to use that feature (c.f. trying to close your Amazon account).</p>

<p>Notice that I’m not talking about speed. The amount of time that you save with
one configuration or another probably isn’t going to save you the amount of time
that you put into setting it up (unless something was <em>really</em> wrong
before-hand). But reducing UX friction can often make you more productive,
reduce extraneous repetitive motion, and eliminate unnecessary mental work to
get from point A to point B. Some things that help towards this end include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reducing mouse usage<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Reducing chorded shortcuts (e.g. minimizing stuff like <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd>)</li>
  <li>Reducing the steps to switch between tools and contexts</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="make-your-tools-accessible-to-an-outsider-without-a-large-amount-of-reconfiguration">Make your tools accessible to an outsider without a large amount of reconfiguration</h3>

<p>Everything that you do to configure your machine is most likely increasing the
barrier to entry somehow. That’s okay. It’s your machine—it should be most
comfortable for <em>you</em>. However, that doesn’t mean there won’t be a time where
someone else might have to use your keyboard or read your monitor. It should be
easy enough for that visitor to understand what’s going on or do some simple
tasks without you restarting your damn machine. Note that that doesn’t mean
disabling all of your config when someone walks over<sup id="fnref:wizardry" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wizardry" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="dont-overdo-it">Don’t overdo it</h3>

<p>Your tools or configuration won’t make you a significantly better developer. It
might even make you a more annoying developer if you won’t stop talking about
such topics. And it always takes time to customize these things—the increased
efficiency won’t make up for that. Again, it’s about getting you to enjoy using
the tools while reducing strain, whether that strain is physical or mental.</p>

<h2 id="tmux">tmux</h2>

<p>I use tmux inside of iTerm2<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. Tmux is a “terminal multiplexer” which is an
incredibly geeky way of saying it allows you to have windows/splits inside of a
OS level window. Here are my main motivations for using it.</p>

<h3 id="attach-and-detach">Attach and detach</h3>

<p>When you start up tmux you’re starting up a server, on which you create and
attach “sessions” (basically just workspaces) where you can create windows
(really closer to tabs) which can have splits. These sessions can be attached
to and detached from at will. And that action is a completely distinct one from
opening or closing iTerm2, meaning if iTerm2 has to close for one reason or
another, my windows and splits set up exactly as when I left them.</p>

<p>This is great on a local machine but invaluable on remote sessions: when I was
doing research on machines that could only be SSH’d into, a random drop in the
Internet connection just meant I had to reattach to the session that was running
on the remote server. Note that the server will still die if your computer has
to restart.</p>

<p>I also find that this navigation is much easier than fiddling with actual
windows in a GUI. Which tend to be pretty poorly organized for search and
retrieval. Even in macOS, if I have a window that is minimized, I have to either
use my mouse to inspect my collection of hidden windows or cycle through them
using <kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>f4</kbd><sup id="fnref:cycle" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cycle" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="prefixes-over-chords">Prefixes over chords</h3>

<p>This is going to be a bit of a recurring theme, but tmux allows you to go from
split to split, window to window, or session to session without pressing many
keys <em>simultaneously</em>. Instead, you can define a common prefix (I have
<kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>) and then press the tmux-specific shortcut
of your choosing.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h3>

<p>If you’re on a Mac, you can use Homebrew:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install tmux
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-tmux-8d784c404340">Here’s</a> a tutorial to get you started.</p>

<h2 id="vimneovim">Vim/Neovim</h2>

<p>I could talk probably all day about Vim and why I love it. I’ll try to summarize
here to save your time and/or sanity. I <em>will</em> note that Vim has a fairly steep
learning curve but I find is worth it in the end. See <a href="http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2012/09/05/vim-is-a-usability-nightmare/">here</a> for
a great blogpost about Vim and usability.</p>

<h3 id="ubiquity">Ubiquity</h3>

<p>Vi or Vim is on basically every *nix machine that you might come across. If you
know how to use it in one place, you can use it anywhere.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-first-design">Keyboard-first design</h3>

<p>Every interaction with Vim is intended to be done with the keyboard. There are
some things that <em>can</em> be done with the mouse (like scrolling or cursor
movement), but it’s primarily designed to be manipulated via the keyboard. That
makes it generally quite fast, eliminating the time to move your hand to the
mouse and back.</p>

<h3 id="composability">Composability</h3>

<p>This is probably the biggest and most Vim-specific point here. When you
manipulate text in Vim, you do so in a sort of “language”, complete with verbs,
nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc.</p>

<p>Let’s say I’m editing a Ruby script and I’ve got this double negative here. We
want to make this a bit more readable, replacing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unless</code> with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> and
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">empty?</code> with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present?</code>.</p>

<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/HRBzkylrV8Bih8llxcEY8nJWV.js" id="asciicast-HRBzkylrV8Bih8llxcEY8nJWV" async=""></script>

<p>Here are all the key presses I needed to do to perform the above:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ciwifjjwwwct?presentjj:wq
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s break that down:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ciw</code>: This is basically a “sentence”. I’m pressing these keys them in what is
called “normal mode”. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code> means “change”, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> means “inner”, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code> means
“word”. “Change” means delete and then go into “insert mode”, the mode where
when I type, those characters appear on screen. I applied that “verb” to what
is called a “text object”. Here that “text object” is made up of the adjective
“inner” with the noun “word”.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>: This is just me typing the word “if”.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code>: This is a command I have set up for “insert mode” that gets me back to
“normal mode”. This is <kbd>escape</kbd> by default but I find this much
easier.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www</code>: Here I’m pressing that “noun” <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code> three times. Since there’s no “verb”
here, that just moves my cursor 1 “word” each time. I could have also typed
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3w</code> and achieved the same thing.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ct?</code>: Here I’m using the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code> verb but this time with the “noun” <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">t?</code>
which means “to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>”, i.e. all the characters from my current position up to
(but not including) the next incidence of the character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code> on the current
line.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">present</code>: This is just me typing the word “present”.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jj</code>: Same as before.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:wq</code>: Here I’m performing what is known as a “command”. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code> gets me into
“command mode” (moving my cursor temporarily to the bottom of the Vim window)
where I then type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">w</code> for “write” (meaning “save”) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">q</code> for “quit”.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a simple example, but as you can see, you can mix and match all these
building blocks to manipulate your files in quite complex ways. Many Vim users
also create plugins that add core “parts of speech” to the editor. E.g.
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">vim-surround</a> enables the sequence <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cs"'</code> which allows you to
“change the surrounding characters” (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cs</code>) from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'</code> as well as the
sequence <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ysiw]</code> “add surrounding characters” (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ys</code>) to the “inner word” (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iw</code>),
specifically brackets (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]</code>).</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-the-terminal">Integration with the terminal</h3>

<p>(Partly thanks to tmux) I can run Vim in the same program that has my
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foreman</code> procs, my git interface, my logs, and pretty much everything else.
Switching between all of those things is super easy thanks to a plugin I use
called <a href="https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator">vim-tmux-navigator</a>. Basically I can use</p>

<ul>
  <li><kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>h</kbd> (left)</li>
  <li><kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> (down)</li>
  <li><kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> (up)</li>
  <li><kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>l</kbd> (right)</li>
</ul>

<p>to navigate between tmux and Vim panes indiscriminately.</p>

<p>When I need to run a test, I have a plugin called <a href="https://github.com/janko-m/vim-test">vim-test</a> that
allows me to run a test in a neighboring tmux pane and then interact with that
terminal session afterwards.</p>

<p>There are many other niceties here as well (e.g. sending the contents of a SQL
query edited in a Vim session to an interactive <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">psql</code> session) that I may go
into in a later post.</p>

<h3 id="so-much-more">So much more</h3>

<p>Again, I can talk about Vim all day (and probably will). There are many things
not covered here that I will return to later (possibly including a breakdown of
my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.vimrc</code>).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-started-1">How to get started</h3>

<p>Like I said before, Vim is famous for having a bit of a steep learning curve.
I’d recommend trying it out in your leisure time because it <em>will</em> slow you down
at first.</p>

<p>Once again, the download for the newest version (probably more up to date than
what you have on your machine already) is on Homebrew as well. However, I’d
recommend installing the relatively recent fork <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neovim</code> instead (it has a few
nicities including better built-in tutorial:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install neovim
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Launch it from the shell (using the name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvim</code>, <em>not</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neovim</code>). Then I’d
follow the built-in tutorial by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:Tutor</code>. The first online resource given
at the bottom of the tutorial, <a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">“Learn Vim
Progressively”</a> is also great—it’s how I first
started.</p>

<h2 id="fzf">FZF</h2>

<p>FZF is a fuzzy-finder for the shell that you can use in a bunch of different
ways, like…</p>

<h3 id="finding-files-while-also-obeying-your-gitignore">Finding files (while also obeying your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>)<sup id="fnref:vim-color-note" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vim-color-note" class="footnote">7</a></sup></h3>
<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/28rDzTqI5nEE9mM89DKZmf5Zo.js" id="asciicast-28rDzTqI5nEE9mM89DKZmf5Zo" async=""></script>

<h3 id="finding-git-commits">Finding git commits</h3>
<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/xYrk74sFKjQXzGKEPJSrdypXs.js" id="asciicast-xYrk74sFKjQXzGKEPJSrdypXs" async=""></script>

<h3 id="finding-old-commands">Finding old commands</h3>
<p>I couldn’t manage to record this one without any potentially sensitive
information, but it works as you might expect.</p>

<p>At its core, FZF is just a way of filtering data in a human-friendly way. You
can pipe anything in and get the same fuzzy-find interface
(e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat file.txt | fzf</code>).</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-started-2">How to get started</h3>

<p>Once again, if you can, just use Homebrew.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install fzf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#using-homebrew-or-linuxbrew">the project’s installation instructions</a> for
details, including howt to integrate FZF with tmux and vim. These integrations
work incredibly well so I’d highly recommend setting that up.</p>
